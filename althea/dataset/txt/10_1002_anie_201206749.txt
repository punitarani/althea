Abstract
Tracking a bug’s life: We describe the first direct and universal approach for labeling
peptidoglycan (PG) of diverse bacteria by exploiting the surprising tolerance of cells for
incorporating unnatural D-amino acids of various sizes and functionalities. These non-toxic D-
amino acids preferably label the sites of active PG synthesis, enabling fine spatiotemporal tracking
of cell wall dynamics in phylogenetically and morphologically diverse bacteria.

Bacterial growth is controlled by the domain-specific peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall, a rigid
and essential structure composed of glycan strands cross-linked by D-amino acid (DAA)-
containing short peptides, whose biosynthesis machinery is a high-value target for
antibiotics.[1] Despite the incredible importance of this megapolymer, our knowledge of PG
dynamics has been severely hampered by the lack of a global strategy for direct imaging of
sites of PG synthesis in live cells. Significant limitations of current labeling methods, such
as toxic effects and poor membrane permeability of the probes, have limited their
applicability to only a small set of bacterial species.[2] Commonly, these methods are labor-
intensive and their sensitivity suffers from their indirect and multiple-step nature. To
overcome these limitations, we sought a chemical biology approach that would enable the
rapid and covalent incorporation and detection of a fluorescently derivatized PG component
during cell wall synthesis in real time, in a wide range of bacterial species and in live cells.
Given the recently established role of PG biosynthetic machinery in incorporating various
natural DAAs in the PG of diverse bacteria, [3] we hypothesized that the mechanisms[3b] for
DAA incorporation in PG are common to the bacterial domain, but still highly selective for
the D-center, and that molecules with various functionalities could be incorporated into the
sites of new PG synthesis if attached to a DAA backbone. To test this hypothesis, we
attached the relatively small fluorophores, 7-hydroxycoumarin 3-carboxylic acid (HCC-OH)
and 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD-Cl), to a D-amino acid backbone, 3-amino-D-
alanine, via a modular and simple synthetic scheme, generating HADA (emission maximum
450 nm, blue) and NADA (emission maximum 538 nm, green) (Scheme 1 and Figure S2).
Growth of the phylogenetically diverse model species Escherichia coli, Agrobacterium
tumefaciens and Bacillus subtilis in the presence of these fluorescent D-amino acids
(FDAAs) for as little as one generation (Figure S1a) resulted in strong peripheral and septal
labeling of entire cell populations (Figures 1 and S3a, upper panels) without affecting
growth rate (Figure S3b). Neither of the fluorescent L-amino acids (FLAAs, prepared from
3-amino-L-alanine, Figure S2c) resulted in significant labeling (Figure S3c), indicating that
labeling is specific to the D-enantiomers. The labeling was exclusive to viable cells treated
with the FDAAs and was not the result of non-specific interaction of FDAAs with the PG
(Figure S4). Additionally, incorporation did not occur into teichoic acids for B. subtilis as
indicated by identical labeling of wild-type and a ΔdltA mutant that does not D-alanylate its
teichoic acids (Figure S5a–b).
Retained fluorescence on the purified sacculi (Figures 1 and S3a, lower panels)
demonstrated that the labeling of PG by the FDAAs was covalent. HPLC analyses of
muropeptides isolated from labeled cells (Figures 2a–c, S6 and S7) revealed that 0.2% –
2.8% of total muropeptides were modified (Figure 2c), which is sufficient for detection in
various experiments while avoiding possible toxicity issues that could result from abundant
incorporation. Significantly, the FDAA-specific peaks, which were absent in samples treated
with FLAAs, could be distinguished from unlabeled muropeptides at FDAA-specific
absorption wavelengths (Figure 2b). MS/MS analyses of FDAA-modified muropeptides in
B. subtilis indicated that FDAAs were exclusively incorporated in the fifth position of the
stem peptide (Figures 2d, S7a, d and Table S1). Interestingly, in a ΔdacA mutant of B.
subtilis, the fraction of labeled muropeptides and the fluorescent signal were substantially
higher than in wild-type B. subtilis, which is likely due to the D,D-carboxypeptidase activity
of DacA (Figure S5c–d). In contrast, the detectable incorporation was solely at the fourth
position in E. coli and A. tumefaciens (Figures 2d and S7). These results are in agreement
with the known sites of incorporation of various natural DAAs in these species and suggest
that, similar to DAAs, FDAAs incorporate mainly through periplasmic exchange reactions
with the muropeptides catalyzed either by D,D-transpeptidases, e.g. in B. subtilis, or by L,D-
transpeptidases, e.g. in E. coli and A. tumefaciens.[3b, 4] This DAA-like behavior together

with the ease of fluorescent detection make FDAAs a strong alternative to radioactive
probes for studying in vitro[3c] and in vivo[5] activities of PG synthesis enzymes.
In contrast to current approaches, [2b, 2f] pulse-chase experiments with HADA allowed the
real-time tracking of new PG incorporation during growth via time-lapse microscopy. In E.
coli and B. subtilis ΔdacA (Figure 3a and Supplementary Movies 1–2), the polar caps
retained the HADA signal, but the signal from the lateral walls dispersed as the cells grew,
in agreement with previous reports of cell wall growth along the length of the lateral
walls. [2f, 5]
Strikingly, short labeling times (2% – 8% of doubling time) using E. coli and B. subtilis
ΔdacA with HADA resulted in preferential localization of the signal at the septal plane of
predivisional cells and in punctate patterns on the lateral walls of elongating cells (Figure 4).
Super-resolution microscopy of E. coli revealed reticulated hoop-like patterns of HADA
labeling around the lateral wall (Figure 3b & Supplementary Movie 3), supportive of bursts
of PG incorporation in the side-walls.[6] This ability of FDAAs to resolve insertion of new
PG provides the first direct detection of zones of PG synthesis in a structured rather than a
random pattern in E. coli, consistent with recent results following the movement of the cell
wall elongation machinery.[7] Short labeling times with A. tumefaciens, whose growth
occurs predominantly from a single pole and the site of cell division while the mother cell
remains inert, [4] resulted in polar and septal labeling. Super-resolution fluorescence
microscopy of labeled cells further enhanced the spatial resolution of the site of active PG
synthesis (Figure 3c & Supplementary Movie 4).
PG labeling in three evolutionarily distant species suggested that FDAAs could specifically
label the active site of PG synthesis across the entire bacterial domain. When species
representing diverse phyla and modes of growth were briefly incubated with FDAAs, we
observed strong labeling at the sites of cell division in actively dividing cells (Figure 4 and
Figure S1b). This septal probe incorporation was the sole mode in Synechocystis sp. PCC
6803, Lactococcus lactis, and Staphylococcus aureus as previously described.[8] Super-
resolution microscopy of Staphylococcus aureus further highlighted the different stages of
these constricting septal rings (Figure 3d and Supplementary Movie 5). Labeling of
Streptococcus pneumoniae occurred in single or split equatorial rings depending on the
length of the cell, with peripheral labeling between the split rings as described.[8] Labeling
of Streptomyces venezuelae was predominantly apical as reported, [9] with some weak
labeling of vegetative septa and lateral walls suggestive of a low but continuous lateral PG
synthesis. In Caulobacter crescentus, labeling occurred at the sites of septal elongation,
lateral elongation, and stalk synthesis, as reported elsewhere.[10]
Bacteria exhibit a myriad of growth patterns that provide selective advantages in the
environment.[11] The strong correlation between FDAA labeling and previously inferred
regions of new PG synthesis in diverse model species has a number of important
implications. First, FDAA labeling marks the sites of active PG synthesis and therefore
provides a long sought broadly applicable tool to study the spatial dynamics of PG synthesis.
Second, these results establish for the first time that the enzymes responsible for DAA
incorporation in the PG are associated with active growth sites and that not all the surface of
the sacculus is equivalent in terms of accessibility to these enzymes. Finally, FDAAs can be
used to discover the growth modes of previously uncharacterized taxa. For example, our
results show that that Burkholderia phytofirmans exhibits polar and midcell PG synthesis,
that Brachybacterium conglomeratum exhibits prominent peripheral PG synthesis in
addition to seemingly alternating perpendicular division planes, and that Verrucomicrobium
spinosum exhibits strong peripheral PG synthesis and asymmetric septal labeling (Figure 4).

The efficient label incorporation in all the bacteria studied thus far also suggests that FDAA,
therefore DAA, incorporation is common to the bacterial domain and FDAAs can thus be
used to analyze natural bacterial populations, providing a convenient and quick standard to
measure bacterial activity and to probe the diversity of growth modes in complex
microbiomes.[11] Indeed, labeling times with FDAAs as short as 2 hours revealed diverse
modes of growth in saliva and freshwater samples in situ, but did not label dead cells as
suggested by the strong correlation with Live-Dead staining (Figures S4b and S8).
Encouraged by the efficiency of FDAAs, we sought to increase our toolkit for PG detection
and modification using differently functionalized unnatural D-amino acids. Following a
similar approach, we derivatized the brighter and more versatile core fluorophore,
fluorescein (emission maximum ~515 nm, green), and its analogue,
carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA, emission maximum ~565 nm, red), [12] with D-
lysine in order to separate the bulky fluorophore from the DAA backbone, generating FDL
and TDL (Scheme 1 and Figure S2a). Incubation of both E. coli and B. subtilis cells with
FDL (536 Da) showed patterns similar to NADA, although labeling of B. subtilis was
stronger than E. coli, presumably due to reduced permeability of the E. coli outer-membrane
to molecules larger than ~500 Da[13] (Figure S9a–c). Indeed, the larger TDL (560 Da) did
not label E. coli cells, but labeling of B. subtilis was prominent and showed patterns similar
to other FDAAs (Figure S9a–b). In order to expand the toolkit further, we used ‘clickable’
D-amino acids, namely ethynyl-D-alanine (EDA) or azido-D-alanine (ADA) (Scheme 1)
that can be specifically captured by any molecule carrying the conjugate functional group
via click-chemistry.[14] Similar to FDAAs, these bioorthogonal DAAs, but not the L-
enantiomer control ELA, labeled both E. coli and B. subtilis cells when captured by
commercially available azido/alkyne fluorophores (Figures S2c–d and S9d–e).
Furthermore, custom D-amino acids containing different colored fluorophores can be used
sequentially to enable “virtual time-lapse microscopy.” Since addition of each new probe
indicates the location and extent of PG synthetic activity during the respective labeling
periods, this approach provides a chronological account of shifts in PG synthesis of
individual cells over time. This powerful method is exemplified here through click
chemistry in gram-negative A. tumefaciens (Figures S1a and 3e), or by the use of TDL in
gram-positive S. venezuelae (Figure 3f).
In contrast to the bacterial protein-making machinery’s inherent bias against unnatural
amino acids, [15] here we have shown that taxonomically diverse bacteria display a
remarkable specific tolerance for incorporating D-amino acids with different sizes and
functionalities into PG. Exploiting this tolerance provides a rapid, non-toxic, and universal
method for real time tracking of PG at sites of active synthesis for the first time. Moreover,
the combined utilization of two or more probes permits a temporal resolution never before
achieved in cell wall growth studies. We expect that in combination with fluorescent protein
fusions, mutational analysis, and chemical perturbations, this methodology will allow a
comprehensive analysis of the regulation and coordination of bacterial growth. Furthermore,
the tolerance for DAAs with substantial sizes or with bio-orthogonal handles will enable
selective and specific modification of bacterial cell surfaces with various functionalities
paving the way for development of DAA-based bacteria-specific diagnostic or therapeutic
probes. Finally, when cells labeled with FDAAs are hybridized with fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) probes, this approach will allow the culture-independent and
concurrent measurement of growth (with FDAAs) and taxonomy (with FISH) and the
response of bacteria to varying conditions in medical or environmental microbiomes.
